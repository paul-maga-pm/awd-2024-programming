        sectionTextContent: "In computer science, programming is not just about writing code but also involves understanding algorithms (step-by-step procedures for solving problems), debugging (fixing errors in code), testing (ensuring the software works correctly), and maintaining (updating and fixing software post-deployment). This requires understanding both high-level concepts and low-level hardware interactions.",
